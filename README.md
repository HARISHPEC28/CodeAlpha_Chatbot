# Simple Python Chatbot

This project is a basic rule-based chatbot created using Python. It responds to common user inputs with predefined replies. It is designed for beginners to understand conditional logic, loops, and text-based interaction in Python.

## Features
- Responds to greetings like "hello", "hi", "hey"
- Replies to common questions such as "how are you?"
- Tells its name when asked
- Says goodbye and exits the program
- Handles unknown inputs with a default response

## How It Works
The chatbot:
1. Continuously takes user input in a loop  
2. Converts the input to lowercase  
3. Matches the input with predefined phrases  
4. Prints an appropriate response  
5. Stops only when the user types "bye", "goodbye", or "exit"

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file named `chatbot.py`
2. Run the file:
   python chatbot.py
3. Chat with the bot in your terminal

## Example Conversation
You: hello  
Bot: Hello! How can I help you?

You: how are you  
Bot: I'm doing great! Thanks for asking.

You: bye  
Bot: Goodbye! Have a nice day!
